# Gridbound

Gridbound is a slowly developed, top-down, grid-based game built in Python using PyGame.

This project is a long-term learning and exploration effort, focusing on:
- Game systems over content
- Clean Python architecture
- Incremental development with small, focused commits

The game starts simple and is designed to evolve over time, potentially incorporating exploration and roguelike elements as systems mature.

## Goals
- Learn and apply Python (OOP and functional concepts)
- Build a maintainable PyGame codebase
- Develop features incrementally, with minimal daily time investment

## Status
Very early prototype.

## Tech
- Python
- PyGame

## Development Philosophy
- One small commit per session
- Refactor freely
- Systems first, polish later
